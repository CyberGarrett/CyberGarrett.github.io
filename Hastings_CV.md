**OBJECTIVE:** Data Science, Research and Development, Business Analysis, Project Management, AI/ML

**SUMMARY:**  From my earliest roles I have expressed a combination of business-minded big-picture scope and the technical training and interest to discern and solve complex problems in collaborative teams. Early problem solving led me to my engineering program where I took internships everywhere from NASA to a boutique marketing company. This interest crystallized in the coffee shop I co-founded with my roommate sophomore year, and carried into graduate school, where I took the podium in a team-based pitch competition. I further developed my problem solving and communication skills in graduate school with multi-disciplinary projects with psychologists and technologists, culminating in the development of a security dashboard that is currently in the patent process.
